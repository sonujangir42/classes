Given data the defect rates (in percentage) for a sample of 300 products:
Defect Rates: 0.5, 1.0, 0.2, 0.7, 0.3, 0.9, 1.2, 0.6, 0.4, 1.1,
0.8, 0.5, 0.3, 0.6, 1.0, 0.4, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 1.3,
0.8, 0.6, 0.4, 0.7, 0.9, 0.5, 0.2, 1.0, 0.8, 0.3,
0.6, 0.4, 0.7, 0.9, 1.2, 0.8, 0.3, 0.6, 0.5, 0.4,
0.7, 0.9, 1.1, 0.3, 1.4, 0,9, 0.6, 0.2, 1.5, 1.0
0.6, 0.4, 0.7, 1.0, 0.8, 0.3, 0.5, 0.8, 0.6, 0.3, 0.9
0.4, 0.7, 0.9, 1.0, 0.8, 0.3, 0.5, 0.6, 0.4, 0.7,
0.9, 1.1, 0.8, 0.3, 0.5, 0.6, 0.4, 0.7, 0.9, 1.0,
0.8, 0.3, 0.5, 0.6, 0.4, 0.7, 0.9, 1.1, 0.8, 0.3,
0.5, 0.6, 0.4, 0.7, 0.9, 1.0, 0.8, 0.3, 0.5, 0.6,

0.9, 1.0, 0.8, 0.3, 0.5, 0.6, 0.4, 0.7, 0.9, 1.1

Quartiles:
First Quartile (Q1): The first quartile is 0.4%. This means that 25% of the products have a defect rate of less than or equal to 0.4%.
Median (Q2): The median defect rate is 0.7%. This indicates that half of the products have a defect rate of less than or equal to 0.7%.
Third Quartile (Q3): The third quartile is 0.9%. This means that 75% of the products have a defect rate of less than or equal to 0.9%.
Percentiles:
25th Percentile (P25): The 25th percentile is the same as Q1, 0.4%.
50th Percentile (P50): The 50th percentile is the same as the median, 0.7%.
75th Percentile (P75): The 75th percentile is the same as Q3, 0.9%.
Interpretation:
The low values of Q1, Q2 (median), and Q3 indicate relatively low defect rates in the production process.
The median defect rate of 0.7% suggests that the typical product has a low likelihood of defects.
The closeness of the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles (0.4%, 0.7%, and 0.9% respectively) indicates a 
narrow spread in the defect rates, suggesting consistency in product quality.
The low defect rates across these percentiles demonstrate an effective quality control system in place, 
resulting in high-quality products.
