Given data  the commute times (in minutes) of a sample of 250 employees:
Commute Times: 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60,
65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100, 105, 110,
115, 120, 125, 130, 135, 140, 145, 150, 155, 160,
165, 170, 175, 180, 185, 190, 195, 200, 205, 210,
215, 220, 225, 230, 235, 240, 245, 250, 255, 260,
265, 270, 275, 280, 285, 290, 295, 300, 305, 310,
315, 320, 325, 330, 335, 340, 345, 350, 355, 360,
365, 370, 375, 380, 385, 390, 395, 400, 405, 410,
415, 420, 425, 430, 435, 440, 445, 450, 455, 460,
465, 470, 475, 480, 485, 490, 495, 500, 505, 510,
515, 520, 525, 530, 535, 540, 545, 550, 555, 560,
565, 570, 575, 580, 585, 590, 595, 600, 605, 610

Quartiles:
First Quartile (Q1): The first quartile is 163.75 minutes. This means that 25% of the employees have a 
commute time of less than or equal to 163.75 minutes.
Median (Q2): The median commute time is 312.5 minutes, indicating that half of the employees have a 
commute time of less than or equal to this amount.
Third Quartile (Q3): The third quartile is 461.25 minutes. This means that 75% of the employees have a 
commute time of less than or equal to 461.25 minutes.
Percentiles:
30th Percentile: The 30th percentile is 193.5 minutes, meaning 30% of employees have a commute time 
less than or equal to this amount.
50th Percentile (Median): The 50th percentile, the same as the median, is 312.5 minutes.
70th Percentile: The 70th percentile is ​​
431.5 minutes, indicating that 70% of the employees have a commute time of less than or equal to this 
amount.

Interpretation:
The distribution of commute times shows a broad range among the employees.
The median commute time of 312.5 minutes (over 5 hours) suggests that the average commute time for this 
sample of employees is quite high.
The difference between the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3) indicates that the middle 50% 
of the employees have commute times ranging from approximately 163.75 minutes to 461.25 minutes. This 
wide range highlights significant variability in the commute times.
The 30th and 70th percentiles further illustrate this spread, showing that while a significant number of 
employees have relatively shorter commutes (less than 193.5 minutes), a considerable portion experience 
much longer commutes (up to 431.5 minutes).
