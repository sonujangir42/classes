The median salary of $252.5 thousand indicates that the majority of the salaries are balanced around this
 value.

 salaries range from $128.75 thousand to $376.25 thousand, indicating the spread of salaries within the 
 company.
The 90th percentile being significantly higher than the median indicates that the top 10% of earners
 have substantially higher incomes compared to the rest.
