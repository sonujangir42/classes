the number of hours spent studying and the corresponding exam scores
for a sample of 30 students:
Hours Spent Studying: 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 22, 25, 28, 30, 32, 35, 38, 40, 42, 45, 48, 50,
52, 55, 58, 60, 62, 65, 68, 70, 72, 75, 78, 80, 82
Exam Scores: 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 82, 85, 88, 90, 92, 93, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 102,
105, 106, 107, 108, 110, 112, 114, 115, 116, 118, 120, 122

The correlation coefficient between the hours spent studying and the exam scores is approximately 0.977.
 This value is very close to 1, indicating a strong positive correlation.

Interpretation of the Correlation Coefficient:
Strength and Direction: A correlation coefficient close to 1 signifies a very strong positive 
relationship. In this context, it means that as the number of hours spent studying increases, the exam 
scores also tend to increase proportionally.
Effectiveness of Studying: The high correlation suggests that there is a strong association between the 
amount of time spent studying and the achievement of higher exam scores. This implies that, generally, 
students who spend more time studying tend to achieve better exam scores.
Educational Implications: This information is valuable for students and educators. It highlights the 
importance of dedicating sufficient time to study in ​​
order to achieve better academic outcomes. For educators, this could inform strategies to encourage 
more effective study habits among students.

Limitation: While the correlation is strong, it's important to note that correlation does not imply 
causation. Factors other than just the number of study hours (such as the quality of study, previous 
knowledge, or testing skills) might also play a significant role in determining exam scores.
