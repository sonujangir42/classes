This scenario can be modeled using a binomial distribution, which describes the number of successes in a 
fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials, each with the same probability of success. Here, a 
"success" is defined as winning a round.

The binomial probability mass function (PMF) is given by:
P(X=x)=(x n)p^x(1−p)*n−x
Using the binomial probability mass function (PMF), we find that the probability of winning exactly 3 out
of 10 rounds is about 26.7%. This reflects the likelihood of achieving this specific number of wins 
under the given conditions
