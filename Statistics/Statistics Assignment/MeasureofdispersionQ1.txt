Given data the number of units produced per hour by the machine for a sample of 10
working days:
Day 1: 120 units
Day 2: 110 units
Day 3: 130 units
Day 4: 115 units
Day 5: 125 units
Day 6: 105 units
Day 7: 135 units
Day 8: 115 units
Day 9: 125 units
Day 10: 140 units

Based on the production output data for a sample of 10 working days, we find the following measures of dispersion:

1. Range of the Production Output
The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the data set.

Maximum output: 140 units
Minimum output: 105 units
Range=Maximum−Minimum=140−105=35 units

2. Variance of the Production Output
Variance measures how spread out the numbers are from the mean.

First, calculate the mean (average) output:

Mean=∑Outputs/Number of Days=120+110+130+…+125+140/10
Then, calculate the variance:

Variance=∑(Output−Mean)^2/Number of Days 
Variance=111.0 units.sq
 
3. Standard Deviation of the Production Output
Standard deviation is the square root of the variance, providing a measure of the average distance of each value from the mean.

Standard Deviation =underroot(Variance)
​
Standard Deviation = 111.0 ≈ 10.54 units
