Hypotheses:
Null Hypothesis (H0): The average weight of the product is 500 grams. 
H0:μ=500 grams.
Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The average weight of the product is not 500 grams.
H1:μ=500 grams.

Test Statistic:
The test statistic for a one-sample t-test is calculated using the formula:
t= x−μ/(s/ underoot(n))

Decision Rule:
The decision to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis will be based on the t-statistic and the 
critical t-value from the t-distribution table for a specified confidence level (usually 95%). The 
degrees of freedom in this case are n−1.

The calculated t-statistic is approximately 2.5, and the critical t-value for a 95% confidence level 
with 24 degrees of freedom (two-tailed test) is approximately 2.064.

In hypothesis testing, if the absolute value of the t-statistic is greater than the critical t-value,
we reject the null hypothesis. Here, since ∣2.5∣>2.064, we reject the null hypothesis.

Therefore, based on this test, there is sufficient statistical evidence to reject the company's claim 
that the average weight of its product is 500 grams. The sample data suggests that the average weight is 
significantly different from 500 grams.
