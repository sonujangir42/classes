Given data the daily sales (in dollars) for the past 30 days:
$500, $700, $400, $600, $550, $750, $650, $500, $600, $550,
$800, $450, $700, $550, $600, $400, $650, $500, $750, $550,
$700, $600, $500, $800, $550, $650, $400, $600, $750, $550
1. Range of the Daily Sales
The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the data set.

Maximum sales: $800
Minimum sales: $400
Range=Maximum−Minimum=$800−$400=$400

2. Variance of the Daily Sales
Variance measures how spread out the numbers are from the mean.

First, calculate the mean (average) sales:

Mean=∑Sales/Number of Days=$500+$700+…+$750+$550/30​
Then, calculate the variance:

Variance=∑(Sale−Mean)^2/Number of Days
Variance=12725.0 dollars

3. Standard Deviation of the Daily Sales
Standard deviation is the square root of the variance, providing a measure of the average distance of each sales value from the mean.

Standard Deviation=underroot(Variance)
​Standard Deviation=12725.0≈$112.81
