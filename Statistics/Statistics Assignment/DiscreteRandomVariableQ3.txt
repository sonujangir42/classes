This problem involves calculating the probability for a binomial distribution, which describes the number
of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials, each with the same probability of success. In this scenario, a "success" is defined as correctly guessing the answer to a question.

The probability of guessing a single question correctly (success probability p) is 1/4 or 0.25, since 
there are four possible answers per question.We need to calculate the probability of getting exactly 
8, 9, or 10 questions correct and sum these probabilities.

The binomial probability mass function (PMF) is given by:
P(X=k)=(k n)p^k (1−p)^(n−k)

By applying this formula, we calculated the probabilities for exactly 8, 9, and 10 correct guesses and 
summed them to get the total probability of getting at least 8 questions correct. The combined probability
 of these scenarios is approximately 0.0416%. This low probability indicates that randomly guessing on 
 such a test has a very small chance of resulting in a high number of correct answers. ​
