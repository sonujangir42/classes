Given data  the monthly revenue (in thousands of dollars) for the past 12 months:
$120, $150, $110, $135, $125, $140, $130, $155, $115, $145, $135, $130
1. Measure of Central Tendency (Average Monthly Revenue)
The average (mean) monthly revenue is calculated by summing all the monthly revenues and dividing by the number of months.

Average Revenue=∑Monthly Revenues/Number of Months
Average Revenue= $120+$150+$110+…+$135+$130/12
Average Revenue=$132.5 thousand

2. Measure of Dispersion (Range of Monthly Revenue)
The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum revenue values in the data set.

Maximum revenue: $155 thousand
Minimum revenue: $110 thousand
Range=Maximum Revenue−Minimum Revenue=$155−$110=$45 thousand
