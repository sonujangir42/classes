The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of times an event occurs within a given interval of 
time or space. The probability mass function (PMF) of the Poisson distribution provides the probability 
of observing a specific number of events (in this case, defects) given a known average rate of occurrence.

The formula for the Poisson PMF is:
F(x;λ)=1−e^−λx
Applying this formula to the given data:
λ=2
x=3
The probability of observing exactly 3 defects in a batch is calculated as having exactly 3 defects in a 
randomly selected batch of smartphones, given that the number of defects per batch follows a Poisson 
distribution with a mean of 2 defects, is approximately 0.180, or 18.0%.
