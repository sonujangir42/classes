Skewness: The skewness of the house price distribution is approximately 0.193.
Kurtosis: The kurtosis of the house price distribution is approximately -1.069.

Conclusion on House Price Distribution:
The slight rightward skewness suggests that while most house prices are clustered around the median, 
there are some houses priced significantly higher than the average, which stretches the tail on the 
higher end.
The negative kurtosis indicates a lack of significant outliers in house prices, meaning there are not
 many houses with extremely high or low prices compared to the general distribution.
