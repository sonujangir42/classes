To determine if there is a significant difference in intelligence between boys and girls based on the 
data provided, we can perform a hypothesis test, specifically an independent two-sample t-test. This 
test is appropriate here as we are comparing the means of two independent groups.

The null hypothesis (H0) for this test is that there is no difference in the mean intelligence scores 
between boys and girls. The alternative hypothesis (H1) is that there is a significant difference.

The formula for the t-statistic in an independent two-sample t-test is:
t= X1−X2/underoot(s1^2/n1 + s2^2/n2)

where:
X1 and X2 are the sample means,
s1^2 and s2^2 are the sample variances,
n1 and n2 are the sample sizes.
​
For girls: Mean (X1) = 89, Standard Deviation (s1) = 4, Size (n1) = 50.
For boys: Mean (X2) = 82, Standard Deviation (s2) = 9, Size (n 2) = 120.
​
The calculated t-statistic is approximately 5.28, and the corresponding p-value is about 3.96×10^−7.
In statistical testing, a low p-value (typically less than 0.05) indicates that the null hypothesis 
(no difference in means) can be rejected. In this case, the p-value is much lower than 0.05, suggesting
 that the difference in mean intelligence scores between girls and boys is statistically significant.

Therefore, based on this test, we can conclude that there is a significant difference in the mean 
intelligence scores of the two groups, contradicting the initial assumption that there is no significant
 difference.
