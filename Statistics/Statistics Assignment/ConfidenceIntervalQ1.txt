To calculate a 95% confidence interval for the population mean height, we can use the following formula 
when the sample size is large (which is generally considered to be the case for n ≥ 30):

Confidence Interval=x±z*(s/underoot(n))

Sample size (n) = 100
Sample mean (x) = 170 cm
Sample standard deviation (s) = 8 cm
Confidence level = 95%

For a 95% confidence level, the z-score is typically 1.96 (this value corresponds to the point that cuts 
off the upper 2.5% of a standard normal distribution, as 95% confidence level leaves 5% in the tails, 
split into 2.5% in each tail).
The 95% confidence interval for the population mean height, based on the provided sample data, is
 approximately from 168.432 cm to 171.568 cm.​
