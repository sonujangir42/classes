Given data  the delivery times (in days) for a sample of 50 shipments:
3, 5, 2, 4, 6, 2, 3, 4, 2, 5,
7, 2, 3, 4, 2, 4, 2, 3, 5, 6,
3, 2, 1, 4, 2, 4, 5, 3, 2, 7,
2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 6, 2, 4, 3, 5,
3, 2, 4, 2, 6, 3, 2, 4, 5, 3
1. Range of the Delivery Times
The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the data set.

Maximum delivery time: 7 days
Minimum delivery time: 1 day
Range=Maximum−Minimum=7−1=6 days

2. Variance of the Delivery Times
Variance measures how spread out the numbers are from the mean.

First, calculate the mean (average) delivery time:

Mean=∑Delivery Times/Number of Shipments 
Mean=3+5+2+4+…+2+4+5+3/50
Then, calculate the variance:
Variance=∑(Delivery Time−Mean)^2/Number of Shipments
Variance=2.29 days
3.Standard Deviation of the Delivery Times
Standard deviation is the square root of the variance, providing a measure of the average distance of each value from the mean.

Standard Deviation=underroot(Variance)
Standard Deviation= 2.29≈1.51 days
