Null Hypothesis (H0): The null hypothesis is the statement that there is no effect or no difference. 
In this case, it would be that the new teaching method does not improve student performance relative to 
the traditional method. It can be stated as:

H0:μ (new)=μ (traditional)

Here,μ (new) represents the mean test score of students taught using the new method, and μ (traditional)
​represents the mean test score of students taught using the traditional method. The null hypothesis posits 
that these two means are equal, indicating no difference in performance between the two teaching methods.

Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The alternative hypothesis is what the researcher is trying to prove. In 
this case, it is that the new teaching method improves student performance. This hypothesis would 
typically be stated as:

H1:μ (new)>μ (traditional)

This is a one-tailed hypothesis, as it specifically states that the new method is better (not just
different) than the traditional method.
​In summary, the null hypothesis states that there is no difference in average test scores between the 
two groups, while the alternative hypothesis states that the group taught with the new method will have
 higher average test scores than the group taught with the traditional method
