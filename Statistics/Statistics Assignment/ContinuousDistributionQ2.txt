In an exponential distribution, the probability of a random variable exceeding a certain value can be 
calculated using the cumulative distribution function (CDF) and then finding its complement.

The formula for the probability of a random variable X exceeding a value x in an exponential distribution is:
P(X>x)=1−F(x;λ)

The result, approximately 40.7%, indicates that there's a significant chance that a light bulb from this 
brand will last longer than 900 hours, according to the exponential distribution model. This probability
 reflects the nature of the exponential distribution where the likelihood of a longer lifetime decreases
  as the duration increases. ​​
