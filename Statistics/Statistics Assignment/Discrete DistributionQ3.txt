To calculate this probability, it's easier to first determine the probability of the complementary event,
 which is not rolling a 6 in any of the three rolls, and then subtracting this probability from 1.

Probability of Not Rolling a 6 in One Roll:

Since the die is fair, the probability of rolling a 6 is 1/6. Therefore, the probability of not rolling a 6 is 
1−1/6=5/6
Probability of Not Rolling a 6 in All Three Rolls:
The events are independent, so the probability of not rolling a 6 in all three rolls is (5/6)^3

Probability of Rolling At Least One 6 in Three Rolls:
This is the complement of not rolling a 6 in any roll. Therefore, it is 1−(5/6)^3
The calculation yields a probability of approximately 42.1%, indicating that there's a significant chance 
of rolling at least one 6 in three rolls of the die.
