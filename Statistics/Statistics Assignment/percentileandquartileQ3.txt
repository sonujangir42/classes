Interpretation:
The distribution shows a steady increase in purchase amounts from lower to higher percentiles.
The median purchase amount of $292.5 suggests that most customers' spending is centered around this value.
The difference between Q3 and Q1 (the interquartile range) is $272.5, indicating the middle 50% of the 
customers' spending ranges from $156.25 to $428.75.
The 80th percentile being higher than the median and Q3 indicates that the top 20% of spenders 
contribute significantly to higher purchase amounts.
