This probability calculation involves the use of the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of a normal 
distribution. The CDF provides the probability that a random variable is less than or equal to a certain 
value.

The probability that an apple weighs less than or equal to the lower limit (140 grams) is calculated using 
the CDF with the given mean and standard deviation.
Similarly, the probability that an apple weighs less than or equal to the upper limit (160 grams) is also
calculated.
The probability of an apple's weight lying in the range between 140 and 160 grams is the difference between 
these two probabilities.
The result indicates that there is about a 68.3% chance that an apple selected at random from the basket 
will fall within this weight range. This reflects the typical range of variability in apple weights around 
the mean of 150 grams in a normal distribution. â€‹
