Given data the monthly returns (%) for the portfolio over a one-year period:
Returns: -2.5, 1.3, -0.8, -1.9, 2.1, 0.5, -1.2, 1.8, -0.5, 2.3,
-0.7, 1.2, -1.5, -0.3, 2.6, 1.1, -1.7, 0.9, -1.4, 0.3,
1.9, -1.1, -0.4, 2.2, -0.9, 1.6, -0.6, -1.3, 2.4, 0.7,
-1.8, 1.5, -0.2, -2.1, 2.8, 0.8, -1.6, 1.4, -0.1, 2.5,
-1.0, 1.7, -0.9, -2.0, 2.7, 0.6, -1.4, 1.1, -0.3, 2.0
1.Skewness
Skewness measures the asymmetry of the distribution of values.
skewness=(n/(n-1)(n-2))summation(variable-mean(variable)/standard deviation)^3
skewness=0.053
A skewness value close to 0 indicates that the distribution of returns is relatively symmetrical.
In this case, a skewness of 0.053 suggests that the returns are fairly symmetrically distributed 
around the mean, with no significant skew to the right or left.
2.Kurtosis: The kurtosis of the monthly returns is approximately -1.295.
The kurtosis value of -1.295 suggests a distribution that is less "peaked" and has lighter tails 
than a normal distribution (which has a kurtosis of 0). This implies fewer extreme values (outliers) 
in the returns than one would expect in a normal distribution.
