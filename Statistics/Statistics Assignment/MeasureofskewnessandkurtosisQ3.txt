Skewness: The skewness of the satisfaction ratings is approximately -0.208.
Kurtosis: The kurtosis of the satisfaction ratings is approximately -0.768.
Interpretation:
Skewness Interpretation:

A skewness value close to 0 indicates a symmetric distribution.
A negative skewness value, as in this case (-0.208), indicates that the distribution is skewed 
to the left. This means that there are more lower satisfaction ratings (towards 1) compared to higher 
ratings (towards 5).
Kurtosis Interpretation:

Kurtosis measures the "tailedness" of the distribution.
A negative kurtosis value (-0.768) indicates a distribution with lighter tails and a less sharp peak 
than a normal distribution. This suggests fewer extreme values (both very high and very low ratings) in 
the satisfaction ratings.
