Given data  the monthly advertising expenditure (in thousands of dollars) and
corresponding sales revenue (in thousands of dollars) for a sample of 12 months:
Advertising Expenditure: 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 22, 25, 28, 30, 32, 35, 38
Sales Revenue: 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100, 105

The correlation coefficient between advertising expenditure and sales revenue is approximately 0.999.
 This value is very close to 1, indicating a strong positive correlation.

Interpretation of the Correlation Coefficient:
Strength and Direction: A correlation coefficient close to 1 signifies a very strong positive 
relationship. This means that as advertising expenditure increases, sales revenue also increases in a 
nearly proportional manner.
Effectiveness of Advertising: The high correlation suggests that the advertising campaigns are highly 
effective. The increase in advertising expenditure is strongly associated with an increase in sales 
revenue.
Decision Making: This information is crucial for the marketing department. Given the strong positive 
relationship, the company can expect that increasing advertising expenditure will likely lead to an 
increase in sales revenue, which can inform decisions about budget allocations for future advertising 
campaigns.
