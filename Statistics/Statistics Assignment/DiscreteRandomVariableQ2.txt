This problem is an example of a hypergeometric distribution, which is used to calculate probabilities 
when sampling without replacement. The hypergeometric probability mass function (PMF) is used to find
the probability of drawing a specific number of successes (in this case, hearts) from a finite 
population without replacement.

The formula for the hypergeometric PMF is:
P(X=k)= (k n)(N−k M−n)/(N M)

In this calculation, we used the hypergeometric distribution with the parameters M=52 (total cards), 
n=13 (total hearts), N=5 (cards drawn), and k=2 (hearts to be drawn) to find the probability of getting 
exactly two hearts in a draw of five cards. The resulting probability is approximately 27.4%.
