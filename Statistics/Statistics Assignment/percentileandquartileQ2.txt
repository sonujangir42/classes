Given data the weights (in kilograms) of a sample of 100 individuals:
Weights: 55, 60, 62, 65, 68, 70, 72, 75, 78, 80,
82, 85, 88, 90, 92, 95, 100, 105, 110, 115,
120, 125, 130, 135, 140, 145, 150, 155, 160, 165,
170, 175, 180, 185, 190, 195, 200, 205, 210, 215,
220, 225, 230, 235, 240, 245, 250, 255, 260, 265,
270, 275, 280, 285, 290, 295, 300, 305, 310, 315,
320, 325, 330, 335, 340, 345, 350, 355, 360, 365,
370, 375,
380, 385, 390, 395, 400, 405, 410, 415,
420, 425, 430, 435, 440, 445, 450, 455, 460, 465,
470, 475, 480, 485, 490, 495, 500, 505, 510, 515

Quartiles:
First Quartile (Q1): The first quartile is 143.75 kg. This means that 25% of the individuals weigh less 
than or equal to 143.75 kg.
Median (Q2): The median weight is 267.5 kg, indicating that half of the individuals weigh less than or 
equal to this amount.
Third Quartile (Q3): The third quartile is 391.25 kg. This means that 75% of the individuals weigh less 
than or equal to 391.25 kg.
Percentiles:
15th Percentile: The 15th percentile is 94.55 kg, meaning 15% of individuals weigh less than or equal
 to this amount.
50th Percentile (Median): The 50th percentile, same as the median, is 267.5 kg.
85th Percentile: The 85th percentile is 440.75 kg, indicating that 85% of individuals weigh less than 
this amount.
Interpretation:
The distribution shows a wide range of weights among the individuals.
The median weight of 267.5 kg suggests a relatively high average weight for the sample population.
The difference between the 75th percentile (Q3) and the 25th percentile (Q1) shows that the middle 50%
 of individuals have weights ranging from 143.75 kg to 391.25 kg, indicating a broad spread of weights.
The 15th and 85th percentiles further illustrate the spread, with a significant difference between the 
lower and upper ends of the weight distribution.
