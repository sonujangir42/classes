Skewness: The skewness of the income distribution is approximately 0.221.
Kurtosis: The kurtosis of the income distribution is approximately -0.945.
Interpretation:
Skewness Interpretation:

A skewness value close to 0 indicates a symmetric distribution.
In this case, a skewness of 0.221 suggests a slight skew to the right, meaning there are somewhat more 
individuals with incomes higher than the average.
Kurtosis Interpretation:

Kurtosis measures the "tailedness" of the distribution.
A kurtosis value less than 0 (which is -0.945 here) indicates a distribution with lighter tails than a 
normal distribution. This suggests fewer outliers, meaning there are fewer individuals with extremely 
high or low incomes compared to a normal distribution.
