This problem involves calculating the probability within a range for a normal distribution.

The cumulative distribution function (CDF) of a normal distribution gives the probability that a random 
variable is less than or equal to a certain value.
To find the probability that a value lies within a range (900 to 1100 hours in this case), we calculate 
the CDF for the upper limit (1100 hours) and subtract the CDF for the lower limit (900 hours).
The probability that a value X lies within the range x1 to x2 in a normal distribution is calculated as:
P(X>x)=1−P(X≤x)

In this case, the calculated probability of approximately 68.3% indicates that there is a high likelihood 
of a light bulb from this brand lasting within this specified range of hours. This reflects the typical 
variability of lifetimes for these light bulbs around the mean of 1000 hours.
