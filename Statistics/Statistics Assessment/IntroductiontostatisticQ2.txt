The Chi-square test evaluates whether there is a significant association between two categorical 
variables. Here, the variables are "smoking status" and "cancer diagnosis." The test compares the 
observed frequencies in each category with the frequencies we would expect if there were no association
between the variables (the expected frequencies).

The Chi-square statistic is calculated using the formula:
χ2=∑(O−E)^2/E 

where O represents the observed frequency, and E represents the expected frequency. The expected 
frequency for each cell in a contingency table is calculated by: 
E= (Row Total)×(Column Total)/(Grand Total)

Calculate Chi-square statistic: Using the observed and expected frequencies, we calculate the sum of (O−E)^2/E
for each cell.

The p-value is then derived from the Chi-square statistic and the degrees of freedom (which, in a 2x2 table, is 1). 
A low p-value indicates that the observed association is unlikely to have occurred by chance, suggesting a significant relationship between the variables.

In our earlier calculation, the Chi-square statistic was 23.14, and the p-value was approximately 1.51×10^−6
.This low p-value indicates that the association observed in your data is statistically significant, meaning 
it is unlikely to be due to random chance.​
